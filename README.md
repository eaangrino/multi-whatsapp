# Multi-WhatsApp

## Overview

**Multi-WhatsApp** was created out of a real, practical need: managing **multiple WhatsApp sessions** at the same time.

For business purposes, having more than one phone number is common (sales, support, personal/business separation, etc.). However, WhatsApp Web and the official desktop apps are designed primarily around a single active session, which quickly becomes a limitation when you need to handle **two or more numbers simultaneously**.

This project solves that problem by allowing multiple independent WhatsApp Web sessions to run side by side inside a single desktop application.

## Why This Project Exists

- Handle **more than two WhatsApp numbers** efficiently
- Avoid constantly logging in and out of WhatsApp Web
- Centralize business communication in one desktop app
- Keep sessions isolated and persistent

The goal is productivity and simplicity, not reinventing WhatsApp.

## Current Features

- Multiple WhatsApp Web sessions
- Persistent sessions (each account keeps its login)
- Fast switching between accounts
- Cross-platform desktop app (Electron + Vite)

## Future Plans

This project is intentionally kept flexible.

Additional features **may be added in the future**, depending on real usage needs, such as:

- Better session management
- UI/UX improvements
- Notifications and per-account controls
- Other productivity-focused tools

There is no fixed roadmap — features will be added only if they solve real problems.
